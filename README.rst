This small library can be used to access data from the FOSSology API via
Python scripts.

See `the OpenAPI
specification <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossology/fossology/master/src/www/ui/api/documentation/openapi.yaml>`_
used to implement this library.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

-  The library package is only available on devops.bt.siemens.com Artifactory:

   .. code:: shell

      pip install -i "https://devops.bt.siemens.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-all/simple" fossology-python

-  Additional dependencies:

   .. code:: shell

      pip install requests

-  Export required environment variables:

   .. code:: shell

      export FOSSOLOGY_TOKEN=<your_fossology_api_token>
      export FOSSOLOGY_SERVER=<your_fossology_server>
      export FOSSOLOGY_USER=<my_fossology_username>

-  Start using the API:

   .. code:: python

      from fossology.api import Fossology
      foss = Fossology(FOSSOLOGY_URL, FOSSOLOGY_TOKEN, FOSSOLOGY_USER)

-  Look at our `documentation
   website <https://fossology.code.siemens.io/fossology-python>`_ for
   further details about using this API.

Develop
-------

-  Install dependencies using ``pipenv`` (*if you're not using
   ``pipenv`` have a look at* `Pipfile <Pipfile>`_ *for a list of
   dependencies*):

   .. code:: shell

      pipenv install

-  Following files are currently available:

   -  `api.py <fossology/api.py>`_: the methods used to interact with
      the server via the Rest API
   -  `obj.py <fossology/obj.py>`_: the classes derived from the JSON
      objects returned from the API

-  Contributions can be performed using `the merge request
   workflow <https://code.siemens.com/help/workflow/workflow.html>`__

-  Use proper
   `docstrings <https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/>`__ to
   document functions and classes

-  Don't forget to extend the minimal `testsuite <test.py>`_ with the
   new functions/classes

-  The `documentation
   website <https://fossology.code.siemens.io/fossology-python>`_ is
   automatically generated by the `Sphinx autodoc
   extension <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_
