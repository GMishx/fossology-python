This small library can be used to access data from the FOSSology API via Python scripts.

See [the OpenAPI specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossology/fossology/master/src/www/ui/api/documentation/openapi.yaml)
used to implement this library.

## Usage

### Installation

* Currently, the library package is only available from source:
  
  ```shell
  pipenv install -e git+git@code.siemens.com:linux/fossology-python.git#egg=fossology-python
  ```

* Additional dependencies:

  ```shell
  pipenv install requests
  ```

* Export required environment variables:

  ```shell
  export FOSS_TOKEN=<your_fossology_api_token>
  export FOSS_URL=<your_fossology_server>
  ```

* Start using the API:

  ```python
  from fossology.api import Fossology
  foss = Fossology(FOSS_URL, FOSS_TOKEN)
  ```

* Look at our [documentation website](https://fossology.code.siemens.io/fossology-python) for further details about using this API.

## Contribute

### Develop

* Install dependencies using `pipenv` (*if you're not using `pipenv` have a look at [Pipfile](Pipfile) for a list of dependencies*):
  
  ```shell
  pipenv install
  ```

* Following files are currently available:
  * [api.py](fossology/api.py): the methods used to interact with the server via the Rest API
  * [obj.py](fossology/obj.py): the classes derived from the JSON objects returned from the API
* Contributions can be performed using [the merge request workflow](https://code.siemens.com/help/workflow/workflow.html)
* Use proper [docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) to document functions and classes
* Don't forget to extend the minimal [testsuite](test.py) with the new functions/classes
* The [documentation website](https://fossology.code.siemens.io/fossology-python) is automatically generated by the [Sphinx autodoc extension](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html)
